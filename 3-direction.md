# Choosing Your Next Direction

## Purpose
This module helps you **choose where to aim next**, without locking you into a brittle plan.

By the end of this module, you will:
- Evaluate a **small, bounded set** of realistic career directions
- Select **one Primary Direction** (your main bet for the next 6–12 months)
- Select **one Secondary Direction** (your insurance path)
- Make tradeoffs and risks **explicit**
- Capture signals that will tell you when to re-evaluate

This module feeds directly into `roadmap.md`.

## Ground Rules

- 2–4 directions maximum  
- No detailed planning yet  
- Think in **12–24 month arcs**  
- Tradeoffs are required  

---

## Step 1 — Constraints Check (Non-Negotiables)

Write down constraints that are **true right now**.

- Constraint 1: …
- Constraint 2: …
- Constraint 3: …
- Constraint 4: …

> If a direction violates a constraint, it is not viable *right now*.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “Given these constraints, which career directions are realistically excluded?”
- “Are any of these constraints assumptions rather than facts?”
- “Which constraint is the biggest limiter right now?”

</details>

## Step 2 — Provided Set of Common Directions

Choose **2–4 directions** from the list below.

- Deepening as a Senior / Staff-level IC  
- Transition to Solution / Technical Architecture  
- Platform / Infrastructure specialization  
- Engineering leadership (Tech Lead / EM)  
- Domain expert (banking, fintech, healthcare, etc.)  
- Internal consulting / cross-team strategist  
- External job move (similar role, better context)

Selected directions:
- Direction A: …
- Direction B: …
- Direction C: …
- Direction D: …

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “Given my background and constraints, which 2–3 of these directions are most realistic?”
- “Which of these directions typically has the lowest switching cost?”
- “Which direction tends to compound career optionality?”

</details>

## Step 3 — Viable Direction Options

For each selected direction, fill this out.

### Direction Option — …

- Why this is viable now:
  - …
  - …
  - …
- Key assumptions:
  - …
  - …

(Repeat for each direction option.)

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “What assumptions am I making about this direction that could be wrong?”
- “What proof would validate or invalidate these assumptions?”
- “What usually causes people to fail in this direction?”

</details>

---

## Step 4 — Option Tradeoffs (Upsides & Costs)

For each direction:

### Direction — …

- Upsides:
  - …
  - …
- Costs / Tradeoffs:
  - …
  - …

> If this feels easy, you are likely undercounting costs.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “What hidden tradeoffs do people underestimate in this direction?”
- “What second-order effects show up after 12 months?”
- “Who usually regrets choosing this path, and why?”

</details>

---

## Step 5 — Directions Explicitly Not Pursued

List directions you are consciously setting aside.

- Direction not pursued: …
  - Reason: …
- Direction not pursued: …
  - Reason: …

These will be copied into `roadmap.md`.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “Which of these directions might be worth revisiting later as a hedge?”
- “What would need to change for one of these to become viable?”
- “Am I avoiding any direction purely out of fear?”

</details>

---

## Step 6 — Primary & Secondary Direction Selection

You now commit to **one main path** and **one insurance path**.

### Primary Direction (Main Bet)

- Direction: …
- Why this is the best focus for the next 6–12 months:
  - …
  - …

### Secondary Direction (Insurance)

- Direction: …
- How this protects you if the primary stalls:
  - …
  - …

### Why this pairing makes sense
- …
- …

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “Does this primary + secondary combination diversify risk?”
- “Is my secondary direction truly independent of the primary?”
- “Which path gives me leverage if conditions change?”

</details>

## Step 7 — Risks I’m Willingly Carrying

Name risks explicitly.

- Risk 1:
  - Light mitigation: …
  - Early warning sign: …
- Risk 2:
  - Light mitigation: …
  - Early warning sign: …
- Risk 3:
  - Light mitigation: …
  - Early warning sign: …

<details>

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

Prompts you can use:
- “What risks am I likely underestimating here?”
- “What usually fails first in this direction?”
- “What early signals precede trouble?”

## Distillation → roadmap.md (Required)

When complete, update `roadmap.md` as follows:

### → Directional Commitments
- Copy your **Primary Direction**
- Copy your **Secondary Direction**
- Copy your **accepted tradeoffs**

### → Directions Explicitly Not Pursued
- Copy items from Step 5
- Include the short reason for each

### → Triggers & Signals
- Copy signals from Step 8
- Place them under:
  - Primary Direction signals
  - Secondary Direction signals

Rules:
- Do not re-explain
- Do not soften language
- These entries should survive re-reading under stress


---

## Output

When complete, you should have:
- 1 Primary Direction  
- 1 Secondary Direction  
- Explicit tradeoffs  
- Explicit risks  
- Clear change signals
