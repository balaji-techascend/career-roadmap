# Direction Options — Your Viable Paths for Next Year

## Purpose of This Module

This file exists to **constrain your career decision space** for the next year.

You are not trying to predict the future or lock in a permanent path.  
You are identifying a **small set of viable directions** that make sense given:

- your current baseline
- your leverage
- your real-world constraints

Clarity here reduces anxiety later.  
If everything is an option, nothing is deliberate.

---

## Constraints to Respect

These constraints come from '1-baseline.md' and '2-leverage.md'.  
They are not preferences, they are reality.

- Time / energy limits:
  - …
- Financial constraints:
  - …
- Role / org constraints:
  - …
- Personal constraints (family, health, geography, etc.):
  - …
- Risk tolerance for the next 12 months:
  - …

**Rule:**  
If a direction violates two or more constraints, it does not belong below.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
"Based on the constraints I listed above and my current background of [provide your background], reflect back which types of career directions are likely viable versus likely unrealistic in the next 12 months.  
Do not suggest new paths.  
Only evaluate feasibility against constraints."

## Viable Direction Options

List **2–4 directions maximum**.

These are not job titles.  
They are **directional bets** you could reasonably pursue over the next year.

### Direction Option 1
- Short description:
  - …
- Why this is viable *now*:

- What this option gives you:
  - stability / influence / optionality / income / learning / reputation

## Option Tradeoffs (Upsides & Costs)

This section forces honesty.

For each direction, capture the **non-obvious costs**, not just the benefits.

- Direction 1:
  - Upside:
    - …
  - Cost / risk:
    - …

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:** 
"For this direction, challenge my assumptions.  
What are the non-obvious costs, risks, or second-order effects someone at my career stage might underestimate?  
Do not add benefits."
</details>

- Direction 2:
  - Upside:
    - …
  - Cost / risk:
    - …

- Direction 3 (if applicable):
  - Upside:
    - …
  - Cost / risk:
    - …

If two options feel equally attractive, you are not being specific enough.

## Directions Explicitly Not Pursued

List paths you are **intentionally not pursuing this year**.

This is not failure.  
This is focus.

Examples:
- Actively job hopping without a clear thesis
- Heavy people-management tracks
- Starting a side business this year
- Relocation-dependent roles

Your list:
- …
- …
- …

## Signals That Would Change Direction

These are **clear triggers**, not vague feelings.

If one or more of these occur, you revisit this file.

- Org-level signals:
  - …
- Role-level signals:
  - …
- Market-level signals:
  - …
- Personal signals:
  - …

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:** 
"Help me convert any vague signals above into concrete, observable events.  
Each signal should be something I could clearly notice within a quarter."
</details>

No signals = drift.

Stop here.  
Do not optimize wording.  
This will evolve.
