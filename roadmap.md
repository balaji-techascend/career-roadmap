# Career Roadmap — Control Panel

> Purpose  
> This file is your active Career Control System.
> It is used to guide decisions, tradeoffs, and adjustments over time.
>
> If a decision is not constrained by the Baseline Truths and Leverage Decisions below,
> it does not belong here.

## Baseline Truths (Anchor)

These truths describe your current career reality.
They are copied from `1-baseline.md` and act as system invariants.

  - …
- Baseline Truth #2:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #5:
  - …

**Rules**
- Do not edit casually
- Update only when reality changes
- Treat these as constraints, not opinions

## Leverage Decisions (from Module 2)

These decisions define **how you allocate career energy**.
They are copied from `2-leverage.md` and should change how you say yes or no.

This section exists to prevent drift back into low-leverage effort.

- Leverage Decision #1:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #2:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #5:
  - …

**Rules**
- These are decisions, not goals
- If everything still feels important, revisit `2-leverage.md`
- Changes here should be rare and intentional
