# Career Roadmap — Control Panel

> Purpose  
> This file is your active Career Control System.
> It is used to guide decisions, tradeoffs, and adjustments over time.
>
> If a decision is not constrained by the Baseline Truths, Leverage Decisions,
> and Direction Commitments below, it does not belong here.

---

## Baseline Truths (Anchor)

These truths describe your current career reality.
They are copied from `1-baseline.md` and act as system invariants.

- Baseline Truth #1:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #2:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #5:
  - …

**Rules**
- Do not edit casually
- Update only when reality changes
- Treat these as constraints, not opinions

---

## Leverage Decisions (from Module 2)

These decisions define **how you allocate career energy**.
They are copied from `2-leverage.md` and should change how you say yes or no.

This section exists to prevent drift back into low-leverage effort.

- Leverage Decision #1:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #2:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #5:
  - …

**Rules**
- These are decisions, not goals
- If everything still feels important, revisit `2-leverage.md`
- Changes here should be rare and intentional

---

## Direction Commitments (Next 6–12 Months)

This section captures **where you are intentionally heading**  
and what you are **not** optimizing for right now.

These are distilled from `3-direction.md`.

### Active Direction(s)

List your **Primary Direction** and (optionally) your **Secondary / Insurance Direction**
for the next 6–12 months.

- Primary Direction:
  - …
- Secondary (Insurance) Direction (optional):
  - …


### Deferred / Not-Pursued Directions

These paths are **intentionally deprioritized** for the current period.

- …
- …
- …

### Direction Thesis (One Sentence)

A short statement that summarizes your current stance.

This sentence should make tradeoffs explicit and help you decide
what *does not* belong on your plate this year.

- “Over the next year, I am primarily optimizing for … while intentionally deprioritizing …”

### Change Triggers

Concrete signals that would cause you to revisit your direction.

Select the **1–2 most meaningful signals per category**.
More than that reduces clarity.

- Org-level trigger:
  - …
- Role-level trigger:
  - …
- Market-level trigger:
  - …
- Personal trigger:
  - …


**Rules**
- Direction ≠ permanent commitment
- If your actions consistently contradict this section, update it
- Avoid adding more than two active directions
