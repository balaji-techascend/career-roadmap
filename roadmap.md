# Career Roadmap — Control Panel

> Purpose  
> This file is your active Career Control System.
> It is used to guide decisions, tradeoffs, and adjustments over time.
>
> If a decision is not constrained by the Baseline Truths below, it does not belong here.

## Baseline Truths (Anchor)

These truths describe your current career reality.
They are copied from `baseline.md` and act as system invariants.

  - …
- Baseline Truth #2:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #5:

**Rules**
- Do not edit casually
- Update only when reality changes
- Treat these as constraints, not opinions

This focus should respect:

## Active Bets

Deliberate, testable moves you are making based on your baseline.

Rules:
- Maximum of **3 active bets**
- Each bet must build on **existing leverage**
- Bets can be internal or external
- If a bet fails, you learn — not panic

  - …
- I am not investing time in the following skills or activities:
  - …
- I am saying no to the following opportunities for now:
  - …

Each item here should be explainable using:
