# Career Roadmap — Control Panel

> Purpose  
> This file is the **authoritative control system** for my career decisions.
>
> It is used to:
> - guide tradeoffs
> - constrain what I say yes and no to
> - detect when conditions have changed
>
> If something is not reflected here, it should not influence my decisions.

This file evolves.  
It is reviewed regularly.  
It is not a plan — it is a filter.

## Baseline Truths (Anchor)

These are **current facts**, not opinions or aspirations.  
They come from `1-baseline.md` and act as system constraints.

- Baseline Truth #1:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #2:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #4:
  - …

**Rules**
- These are not edited casually
- They change only when reality changes
- If a decision violates a baseline truth, it is invalid

## Leverage Decisions (Energy Allocation)

These decisions define **where effort compounds** and where it does not.  
They come from `2-leverage.md`.

### Leverage Priorities
Things I will intentionally invest in, even when busy:

- Priority #1:
  - …
- Priority #2:
  - …

### Explicit Non-Priorities
Things I am intentionally **not optimizing for** right now:

- Non-priority #1:
  - …
- Non-priority #2:
  - …

### Key Assumptions
These leverage choices depend on:

- Assumption #1:
  - …
- Assumption #2:
  - …

If these assumptions break, leverage decisions must be revisited.

## Directional Commitments (6–12 Month Horizon)

These choices define **where I am aiming**, not a permanent identity.  
They come from `3-direction.md`.

### Primary Direction (Main Bet)

- Direction:
  - …
- Why this is my main focus now:
  - …
- Tradeoffs I am accepting:
  - …

### Secondary Direction (Insurance Path)

- Direction:
  - …
- How this protects me if the primary stalls:
  - …

### Directions Explicitly Not Pursued

These paths are consciously set aside to reduce noise:

- Direction not pursued:
  - Reason:
    - …
- Direction not pursued:
  - Reason:
    - …

## Positioning (How I Am Currently Being Reinforced)

This defines how I want my work to be **understood**, not advertised.  
It comes from `4-positioning.md`.

### Current Positioning Statement

- …

### Outcomes I Am Actively Reinforcing

These are **observable results**, not skills:

- Outcome #1:
  - …
- Outcome #2:
  - …
- Outcome #3:
  - …

### Visibility I Am Intentionally Avoiding

To prevent distraction or dilution:

- …

## Current Focus (Now)

This is what I am optimizing for **this quarter**.

If something competes with this and is not listed, it loses.

- Focus Area #1:
  - …
- Focus Area #2:
  - …
- (Optional) Focus Area #3:
  - …

---

## Active Bets

These are deliberate bets made **without certainty**.  
They require attention and monitoring.

Limit: **1–3 active bets total**.

### Active Bet #1
- What I am betting on:
  - …
- Why this bet exists now:
  - …
- What success would look like:
  - …
- What would invalidate this bet:
  - …

(Optional)
### Active Bet #2
- …

## Triggers & Signals

These tell me **when to pause, adjust, or change course**.  
They come from `3-direction.md` and `5-execution.md`.

### Signals to Watch

Changes in environment, structure, or demand:

- Signal #1:
  - …
- Signal #2:
  - …
- Signal #3:
  - …

### Decision Triggers

Clear conditions that require action, not debate:

- Trigger #1:
  - …
- Trigger #2:
  - …

When a trigger fires, this roadmap must be reviewed.

## What I’m Intentionally Not Doing

This section preserves leverage and focus.

If something is not allowed here, it will creep back in.

- I am not investing in:
  - …
- I am not optimizing for:
  - …
- I am explicitly avoiding:
  - …

## Operating Rules

- This file is reviewed:
  - monthly (quick pass)
  - quarterly (deeper reset)
- Changes must have a reason
- Fewer decisions beat more ideas
- Calm consistency beats reactive motion

This roadmap exists so I don’t have to rethink everything under pressure.
