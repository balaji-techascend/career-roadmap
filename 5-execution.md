# Execution & Control — Running the System

## Why this exists

At this point, you have already made real choices:
- how your role actually works
- where your leverage comes from
- which direction you are aiming toward
- how you want others to experience your work

This file makes sure those choices show up in how you spend your time.

You use this to stay deliberate week after week, even when work gets busy or noisy.

## How to use this file

- Write in bullets  
- Keep it short  
- Choose what deserves attention now  
- Everything here feeds into 'roadmap.md'

You are setting guardrails for action, not documenting your career.

## 1. Quarterly Focus Areas

Decide what deserves **extra attention this quarter**.

Pick **one to three** areas you are willing to protect time and energy for.

These are where you slow down, say no more often, and stay patient.

Examples:
- Take clearer ownership of one business-critical system
- Build trust with one specific leadership group
- Create proof around a cross-team outcome
- Reduce operational drag by stepping away from a low-leverage responsibility

Write your current focus areas:

- Focus Area #1:
  - …
- Focus Area #2:
  - …
- (Optional) Focus Area #3:
  - …

> If everything feels important, you have not chosen yet.

Prompt:
> Based on my baseline, leverage choices, and positioning, what 2–3 focus areas would give me the most leverage over the next few months?

</details>

## 2. Active Bets

Active bets are choices you make without certainty.

You see potential upside, you accept risk, and you commit attention anyway.

Keep this to **one or two bets** at a time.

For each bet, be explicit:

### Active Bet #1
- What I am betting on:
  - …
- Why I am making this bet now:
  - …
- What success would look like:
  - …
- What would tell me this bet is no longer worth it:
  - …

(Optional)
### Active Bet #2
- What I am betting on:
  - …
- Why I am making this bet now:
  - …
- What success would look like:
  - …
- What would tell me this bet is no longer worth it:
  - …

Examples:
- Becoming the trusted owner of a fragile but high-impact system
- Building visible proof of influence in architectural decisions
- Positioning for a specific internal role change over the next year

Prompt:
> Pressure-test these bets.  
> Where might I be overestimating upside or underestimating effort or risk?

</details>

## 3. Monthly Actions

This is where thinking turns into movement.

List **specific actions** you will take this month that directly support:
- your quarterly focus areas
- your active bets

These should be small enough to finish and concrete enough to notice.

Examples:
- Schedule one stakeholder or skip-level conversation
- Share one clear artifact that shows ownership or progress
- Hand off or exit one low-value responsibility
- Write one short internal document that clarifies decisions or scope

Write only what you realistically expect to complete:

- Action #1:
  - …
- Action #2:
  - …
- Action #3:
  - …

> If an action does not support a focus area or bet, leave it out.

## 4. Signals to Watch

Signals tell you when conditions are changing.

They help you adjust early instead of reacting late.

Look for concrete changes in:
- structure
- expectations
- ownership
- demand for your input

Examples:
- Leadership changes or re-orgs
- Shifts in scope or scrutiny
- Budget tightening or expansion
- Patterns where people rely on you more—or stop relying on you

Write the signals that matter for you:

- Signal #1:
  - …
- Signal #2:
  - …
- Signal #3:
  - …

<details>

Prompt:
> Given my role and direction, what signals should I actively watch so I can adjust without panic?

</details>

## 5. Decision Triggers

Decision triggers tell you when to pause, change, or exit.

They prevent long periods of waiting without reflection.

Each trigger should be clear enough that you will recognize it when it happens.

Examples:
- If progress stalls past a specific date
- If sponsorship or scope changes materially
- If effort keeps increasing without visible payoff

Write only triggers you are willing to act on:

- Trigger #1:
  - …
- Trigger #2:
  - …
