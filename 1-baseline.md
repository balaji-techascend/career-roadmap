# Career Leverage — What to Invest In (and What to Stop)

## Why this exists

This module helps you make **deliberate decisions about where your career energy goes**.

At mid-to-senior levels, career outcomes are no longer driven by effort alone.
They are driven by **where effort is applied and where it is not**.

Most experienced developers over-invest in things that *feel* responsible or productive,
but no longer compound influence, trust, or options.

This module forces explicit tradeoffs.

**What this unlocks**
- Less wasted effort on low-return work
- More capacity for things that actually compound
- Reduced anxiety caused by "doing everything"
- Clear inputs for prioritization in later modules

## How to use this file

- Bullet points only  
- Be specific and concrete  
- "Good enough" answers are fine  
- This is about **allocation**, not aspiration  
- You must stop or reduce something for this module to be complete  
- Time-box this to **30–45 minutes total**

If nothing feels uncomfortable to write or cut, you are probably being too safe.

## 1. Where Is My Effort Actually Going?

Describe reality, not intent.

- Most of my work time currently goes to:
  - …
  - …
- Most of my mental energy (thinking, worrying, preparing) goes to:
  - …
  - …
- Most of my learning or upskilling time goes to:
  - …
- When things get busy or uncertain, I default to:
  - …

**Constraint:**  
Do not evaluate yet. Just describe where energy is actually spent.

## 2. What Effort Is Actually Paying Off?

Identify activities with **observable returns**, not hoped-for ones.

- Effort or investment that has produced real returns:
  - What I invest in:
    - …
  - What return it has produced (trust, influence, visibility, options):
    - …
  - Who notices or benefits:
    - …

- (Optional second item if applicable)
  - …

If there is no evidence of return, leave it out.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
Based only on what I’ve written, point out patterns in what types of effort
seem to produce returns versus those that do not.
Do not suggest what I should do next.
</details>

## 3. What Feels Productive but No Longer Compounds?

These are activities that feel safe, responsible, or busy,
but produce diminishing career returns.

- Activity that feels productive:
  - …
  - Why I keep doing it:
    - …
  - What it actually returns now:
    - …

- (Optional second item)
  - …

Be honest. This section should feel slightly uncomfortable.

**Prompt:**  
Help me check whether the returns I listed are concrete or vague.
Do not add new activities.
Do not tell me to stop anything.

## 4. What Actually Creates Leverage for Me?

Identify **categories of effort** that amplify impact beyond raw execution.

Think in terms of:
- trust
- reuse
- decision influence
- visibility beyond your immediate team
- portability across roles or companies

- Leverage category that compounds for me:
  - …
  - Why this compounds in practice:
    - …

- (List up to 3–5 total)
  - …

This is not about tactics yet. Only what *matters*.

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional AI Assist (click to expand)</strong></summary>

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
Help me restate these as clear leverage statements
(e.g., "This compounds because…").
Do not invent leverage I didn’t list.
</details>

## 5. What Will I Stop or Reduce? (Required)

This section creates capacity. It is mandatory.

### Stop
Things I will intentionally stop investing energy in:
- …
- …

### Reduce
Things I will continue, but with explicit limits:
- …
- …

### Conditional Only
Things I will do only with clear justification:
- …
- …

**Constraint:**  
If this list does not cost me something, it is not real.

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional AI Assist (click to expand)</strong></summary>

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
Help me rewrite my stop / reduce items so they are concrete and unambiguous.
Do not argue against stopping them.
</details>

## 6. Near-Term Reallocation (Next 90 Days)

Based on everything above, for the next 90 days:

- I will invest more energy in:
  - …
- I will explicitly protect time for:
  - …
- I will ignore or deprioritize without guilt:
  - …

Keep this short. Fewer than 5 bullets total.

## Leverage Decisions (Required)

From this module, extract **3–5 leverage decisions** that feel accurate even if uncomfortable.

These should clearly influence how you say yes or no over the next 3–6 months.

- Leverage Decision #1:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #2:
  - …
- Leverage Decision #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Leverage Decision #5:
  - …

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional AI Assist (click to expand)</strong></summary>

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
Check whether these leverage decisions are:
- grounded in what I wrote earlier
- stated clearly
- free of vague intent or future promises

Do not rewrite unless I ask.
</details>

## Roadmap Transfer (Do This Before Moving On)

Copy the following into `roadmap.md`:
- 1–2 leverage priorities
- 1–2 explicit non-priorities
- Any key assumption these depend on

These are **inputs** to the Career Control System, not final answers.

When you’re done, move on.  
Leverage only compounds if you act on it.
