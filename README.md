# Career Roadmap — Control System

This repository is a **private career control system**.

It is not documentation.  
It is not a journal.  
It is not meant to be polished or impressive.

Its purpose is to help you **make clearer, calmer career decisions** through the next year — and to keep doing so as conditions change.

The goal is **clarity and control**, not certainty.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A thinking system that turns reflection into decisions
- A private workspace you return to, not something you “finish”
- A lightweight control panel for navigating uncertainty

Everything in this repo exists to support **one file**:

> **`roadmap.md` — your active Career Control System**

All other files exist to *feed* it.

## Repository Structure

career-roadmap/  
├─ README.md ← how to use the system  
├─ 1-baseline.md ← grounding reality  
├─ 2-leverage.md ← effort allocation  
├─ 3-direction.md ← direction selection  
├─ 4-positioning.md ← how you will be seen  
├─ 5-execution.md ← operating cadence  
└─ roadmap.md ← authoritative control panel  


- All numbered `.md` files are **working layers**
- `roadmap.md` is the **only authoritative file**
- Markdown only
- Shallow structure
- Repo is private by default

Do not add new files or sections.

## How to Use This Repo (Once)

Initial setup is done **one time**, in order:

1. Work through each numbered `.md` file from 1 → 5  
2. Write bullet points only  
3. Stop when the file tells you to stop  
4. At the end of each file, **distill key bullets into `roadmap.md`**

“Good enough” answers are expected.

This phase creates your **starting control system**.

---

## How to Use This Repo (Ongoing)

After setup, this repo becomes a **guidance system**, not something you constantly edit.

- **Weekly:** Read `roadmap.md` once to internalize priorities and guide actions  
- **Monthly:** Do a short review (10–15 minutes). Adjust **one thing at most** and commit with a reason  
- **Quarterly:** Step back and reassess more deliberately. Revisit supporting files only if needed and update `roadmap.md`

Most weeks involve **reading only**.  
Changes are intentional and infrequent.


This repo evolves as your career evolves.

---

## Operating Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Bullet points only
- “Good enough” beats perfect
- No polishing
- No adding sections
- No expanding scope
- Stop when prompted to stop
- External tools are optional, not required

This system works because it is constrained.

---

## Role of `roadmap.md` (Critical)

`roadmap.md` is **not a summary**.

It is a living Career Control System that answers, at all times:

1. What am I optimizing for right now?
2. What am I intentionally not doing?
3. What would cause me to change direction?

If something does not affect those answers, it does not belong there.

---

## What Each File Is For

You may revisit older files **selectively** for reference:

- `1-baseline.md` → grounding reality
- `2-leverage.md` → effort allocation
- `3-direction.md` → preventing reactive pivots
- `4-positioning.md` → visibility decisions
- `5-execution.md` → restoring momentum

They support thinking.  
They do not drive decisions.
