# Career Roadmap 2026

This repository is a private career control system.

It is not documentation.
It is not a journal.
It is not meant to be polished.

Its purpose is to help you make clearer career decisions through 2026.

## How to Use This Repo

- Each `.md` file represents a thinking layer.
- You work through them once, then revisit selectively.
- `roadmap.md` is the only file you return to regularly.

The goal is **clarity and control**, not certainty.

## Operating Rules

- Bullet points only
- “Good enough” beats perfect
- Stop when prompted to stop
- No adding new sections
- No external tools required

## Usage Rhythm

Initial setup:
- Work through each file once, in order
- Distill outcomes into `roadmap.md`

Ongoing:
- Revisit `roadmap.md` monthly or bi-weekly
- Adjust one thing
- Commit with a short reason

This repo should evolve as your career evolves.
