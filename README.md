# Career Roadmap — Control System

This repository is a **private career control system**.

It is mission control for the next 12 months that you will create.
Just signal extraction and course correction as conditions change. We are not talking about polish or performance.

The target is **Agency** with **clarity and control**. Certainty doesn't exist anyway.

## Part of the Career Control System Course

This repository is the core working artifact used in the **Career Control System** course.

The course provides the context, decision frameworks, and walkthroughs that explain **how** and **why** to use this repo correctly—without turning it into busywork or documentation.

In addition, the course includes:
- Access to the founding community for shared patterns, questions, and calibration
- Lightweight email follow-ups designed to help you stay on track and actually use the system over time

## What This Repo Is

- A thinking system that turns reflection into decisions
- A private workspace you return to, not something you “finish”
- A lightweight control panel for navigating uncertainty

Everything in this repo exists to support **one file**:

> **`roadmap.md` — your active Career Control System**

All other files exist to *feed* it.

## Repository Structure

career-roadmap/  
├─ README.md ← how to use the system  
├─ 1-baseline.md ← grounding reality  
├─ 2-leverage.md ← effort allocation  
├─ 3-direction.md ← direction selection  
├─ 4-positioning.md ← how you will be seen  
├─ 5-execution.md ← operating cadence  
└─ roadmap.md ← authoritative control panel  


- All numbered `.md` files are **working layers**
- `roadmap.md` is the **only authoritative file**
- Markdown only
- Shallow structure
- Repo is private by default

Do not add new files or sections.

## How to Use This Repo (Once)

Initial setup is done **one time**, in order:

1. Work through each numbered `.md` file from 1 → 5  
2. Write bullet points only  
3. Stop when the file tells you to stop  
4. At the end of each file, **distill key bullets into `roadmap.md`**

“Good enough” answers are expected.

This phase creates your **starting control system**.

---

## How to Use This Repo (Ongoing)

After setup, this repo becomes a **guidance system**, not something you constantly edit.

- **Weekly:** Read `roadmap.md` once to internalize priorities and guide actions  
- **Monthly:** Do a short review (10–15 minutes). Adjust **one thing at most** and commit with a reason  
- **Quarterly:** Step back and reassess more deliberately. Revisit supporting files only if needed and update `roadmap.md`

Most weeks involve **reading only**.  
Changes are intentional and infrequent.


This repo evolves as your career evolves.

---

## Operating Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Bullet points only
- “Good enough” beats perfect
- No polishing
- No adding sections
- No expanding scope
- Stop when prompted to stop
- External tools are optional, not required

This system works because it is constrained.

---

## Role of `roadmap.md` (Critical)

`roadmap.md` is **not a summary**.

It is a living Career Control System that answers, at all times:

1. What am I optimizing for right now?
2. What am I intentionally not doing?
3. What would cause me to change direction?

If something does not affect those answers, it does not belong there.

---

## What Each File Is For

You may revisit older files **selectively** for reference:

- `1-baseline.md` → grounding reality
- `2-leverage.md` → effort allocation
- `3-direction.md` → preventing reactive pivots
- `4-positioning.md` → visibility decisions
- `5-execution.md` → restoring momentum

They support thinking.  
They do not drive decisions.
