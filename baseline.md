# Career Baseline — Your Starting Point

## Why this exists

This module helps you establish a **clear, factual baseline** of your current career reality.

Most experienced developers carry this information loosely in their head.  
Writing it down exposes where **assumptions, incentives, and reality diverge**.

This is a diagnostic step that makes future decisions calmer and more deliberate.

**What this unlocks**
- Clearer tradeoffs in later modules
- Earlier detection of real risk (not imagined risk)
- Fewer reactive or emotional decisions
- Reduced background anxiety caused by ambiguity

## How to use this file

- Bullet points only  
- Be specific and concrete  
- "Good enough" answers are fine  
- No future planning here  
- Time-box this to **30–45 minutes total**

If something feels slightly uncomfortable to write, you are probably doing it right.

## 1. What Is My Role Actually Optimized For?

Describe what your role *really* exists to deliver today, not what it should become or your title (be very honest).

- Core outcomes my role reliably produces:
  - …
  - …
- Problems I'm consistently pulled into when things matter:
  - …
- If I stopped working for 30 days, the biggest gaps would be:
  - …

**Constraint:**  
Do not describe aspirations or future scope. Only current reality.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**  
Given the bullets I’ve written above, help me rephrase them into clearer,
more concrete statements of what my role is actually optimized for.
Do not add new responsibilities or speculate beyond what I’ve written.

## 2. What Actually Gets Rewarded Currently?

Separate effort from reward.

- Behaviors or contributions that are visibly rewarded (raises, trust, influence):
  - …
- Work that is praised but does not materially change my position:
  - …
- Work that is critical but mostly invisible:
  - …

**Reminder:**  
Disliking what gets rewarded does not make it untrue.

**Prompt:**
Based on what I've listed as rewarded vs praised work,

Only analyze what's written. Do not suggest changes.

## 3. Where Am I Exposed?

Name risks that could materially affect your role or options.

- Role-level exposure (replaceability, narrow ownership, dependencies):
  - …
- Organization-level exposure (strategy shifts, budget pressure, leadership churn):
  - …
- Market-level exposure (how this role translates externally):
  - …

Do not solve or rank risks here. Just name them.

Review the risks I've listed and help categorize them as:

Do not rank them or add new risks.

## 4. What Leverage Do I Already Have?

Inventory existing leverage, not aspirational leverage.

- Knowledge, context, or skills that would be costly to replace:
  - …
- Relationships or trust that give me informal influence:
  - …
- Areas where my opinion already carries weight:
  - …

If it already works in practice, it counts as leverage.

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**
Based on my leverage list, help me restate these as concise leverage statements
(e.g., "I am trusted for X because Y").
Do not invent leverage I didn't list.
</details>

## 5. What Constraints Must I Respect?

State constraints explicitly. These are design inputs, not weaknesses.

- Time and energy constraints:
  - …
- Financial or risk constraints:
  - …
- Personal or psychological constraints (what I am unwilling to tolerate):
  - …

Ignoring constraints leads to plans you won't execute.

<details>

If you already think clearly in writing, you can skip this.

**Prompt:**
Help me check whether the constraints I've listed are concrete and specific.
Flag any that are vague so I can tighten them.
Do not challenge or override them.

## Baseline Truths (Required)

From everything above, extract **3–5 baseline truths** that feel accurate even if uncomfortable.

These should describe:
- Your current reality
- Not aspirations
- Not fears

- Baseline Truth #1:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #2:
  - …
- Baseline Truth #3:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #4:
  - …
- (Optional) Baseline Truth #5:
  - …

<!-- Optional AI Assist
Given my baseline truths above, help me check whether they are:
- grounded in what I wrote earlier
- stated clearly and specifically
- free of future planning or optimism

Do not rewrite them unless I ask.

## Roadmap Transfer (Do This Before Moving On)

Copy your **Baseline Truths** into `roadmap.md`.

These truths will:
- Constrain future choices
- Inform active bets
- Define triggers for change

Do not modify them yet.  
They are inputs to the system, not conclusions.

When you're done, move on.  
Clarity compounds only when you keep going.
