# Career Leverage - What to Invest In (and What to Stop)

This module exists to help you **allocate career energy deliberately**.

The goal is not to do more.  
The goal is to **stop wasting effort on things that no longer compound**.

Bullet points only.  
“Good enough” answers are sufficient.

---

## 1. Current Effort Map (Reality Check)

Describe where your energy actually goes today.

- Where most of my **work time** goes
- Where most of my **mental energy** goes (even off-hours)
- Where most of my **learning / upskilling** time goes
- What I default to when things get busy or uncertain

Do not judge yet. Just capture reality.

---

## 2. What Currently Pays Off (Evidence-Based)

List only things that have produced **observable returns**.

For each item, note:
- What I invest in
- What return it has produced (trust, visibility, influence, optionality, growth)
- Who notices or benefits from this

If there is no evidence, it does not belong here.

---

## 3. What Feels Productive but Isn’t (Low-Leverage Traps)

These are activities that feel safe, responsible, or “professional”  
but no longer move your career forward meaningfully.

For each item:
- What I keep doing
- Why I keep doing it
- What it actually returns *now* (not historically)

Be honest. Discomfort here is expected.

---

## 4. Leverage Multipliers (What Actually Compounds)

Identify categories of effort that **amplify impact** beyond raw execution.

If Section 2 is about what has paid off so far, this section is about what tends to compound going forward — even if it hasn’t yet.

Think in terms of:
- Trust that travels beyond one manager or team
- Work that gets reused or referenced
- Input into decisions, not just delivery
- Skills or artifacts that survive role changes

List **3–5** areas only.  
No tactics yet. Just what *matters*.

---

## 5. Stop / Reduce List (Explicit Tradeoffs)

This section creates capacity.

### Stop 

Things I will **intentionally stop doing**:
- ...
- ...

### Reduce

Things I will do **less of, by design**:
- ...
- ...

### Conditional Only
Things I will do **only with clear justification**:
- ...
- ...

Rules:
- Be concrete
- Avoid “someday”
- If this doesn’t sting a little, it’s not real

---

## 6. Near-Term Reallocation (Next 90 Days)

Based on the above, for the next 90 days:

- I will invest more energy in:
  - ...
- I will protect time for:
  - ...
- I will ignore without guilt:
  - ...

Keep this short. Fewer than 5 bullets total.
Make sure these choices respect the constraints you captured in 1-baseline.md

---

## Distillation → roadmap.md (Required)

Before moving on, update the following sections in `roadmap.md`:

### → Leverage Decisions (Energy Allocation)

Copy:
- 1–2 items into **Leverage Priorities**
- 1–2 items into **Explicit Non-Priorities**
- Any assumption these depend on into **Key Assumptions**

Rules:
- Phrase these as decisions, not goals
- They must change how you say yes or no
- If a choice feels reversible, it is too weak

Do not copy raw notes.  
Only transfer what should actively constrain future effort.


**Completion Check**

This module is complete only if:
- At least one Leverage Decision was added or updated
- At least one stop / reduce choice is reflected in `roadmap.md`
