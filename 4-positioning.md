# Positioning & Proof — How I Will Be Seen

## Why this exists

This module turns your **chosen direction** into **deliberate visibility**.

Most experienced developers assume:
- Good work will speak for itself
- If they are valuable, it will be obvious
- Visibility is political or forced

In practice, senior careers stall because:
- Outcomes are unclear to decision-makers
- Proof is scattered or invisible
- Others define the narrative by default

This file helps you **decide how you want to be seen**,  
and what *minimal proof* supports that—without self-promotion or noise.

**Output of this module**
- One clear positioning statement
- A short list of outcomes to be known for
- A realistic proof-of-work plan
- A low-drama visibility strategy

## How to use this file

- Bullet points only  
- Think in **signals**, not branding  
- Favor internal clarity over external polish  
- “Enough to be seen” beats “perfectly packaged”  

You are not creating content.  
You are shaping perception through evidence.

## 1. My Positioning Statement

This is **not a title** and not a resume line.

It is a simple sentence that answers:
> Why do people trust me with this kind of work?

**Constraints**
- One sentence only
- Concrete, not aspirational
- Based on work you already do or can credibly do next
- Aligned with your primary direction from `3-direction.md`

**Write it**
- …

## 2. Outcomes I Want to Be Known For

These must be **observable outcomes**, not skills or traits.

Focus on:
- What improves when you are involved
- What becomes easier or safer for others
- What leaders gain confidence in

**Constraints**
- 3–5 outcomes maximum
- Written as results, not activities
- No tools, frameworks, or role labels

**List outcomes**
- …
- …
- …

## 3. Proof That Actually Matters

Not all proof carries equal weight.

This section filters for proof that is:
- Directly tied to your chosen direction
- Easy for others to recall or reference
- Naturally produced through real work

Weak proof requires explanation.  
Strong proof travels without you.

**Constraints**
- Concrete artifacts, decisions, or visible changes
- Must already exist or be realistically created
- Avoid speculative or future-only proof

**Proof signals**
- …
- …
- …

## 4. Who Needs to See This Proof

Visibility is **targeted**, not broadcast.

List the specific people or forums whose perception actually matters.

**Constraints**
- Roles or groups, not names
- Small and intentional
- Limited to those who influence trust, scope, or decisions

**Primary audience**
- …
- …

**Secondary audience (optional)**
- …
- …

## 5. Low-Drama Visibility Plan

This is how proof becomes perception **without self-promotion**.

Focus on:
- Existing forums and rituals
- Natural moments of explanation or clarification
- Repeatable, low-effort actions

**Constraints**
- 3–6 actions maximum
- Must fit into normal work
- No constant broadcasting or chasing attention

**Visibility actions**
- …
- …
- …

If an action requires frequent reminders or personal advocacy, it does not belong here.

## 6. Distillation → `roadmap.md`

After completing this file, update `roadmap.md` with the following:

### Current Focus (Now)
- One sentence describing the positioning you are actively reinforcing

### Active Bets
- One positioning-related bet, including:
  - Why this positioning matters now
  - What proof would confirm it is working
  - What signal would invalidate it

### What I’m Intentionally Not Doing
- One visibility behavior you are explicitly avoiding

This ensures positioning is **managed**, not accidental.

## Optional AI Assist (click to expand)

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional AI Assist</strong></summary>

Use AI only to **clarify and stress-test**, not to invent.

**Prompt 1 — Tighten clarity**
> Help me make this positioning statement more concrete and easier to understand, without adding ambition or new scope:  
> [paste statement]

**Prompt 2 — Stress-test proof**
> Given this career direction and audience, which of these proof signals are strongest and which are weakest? Why?  
> [paste bullets]

**Prompt 3 — Noise check**
> Do any of these visibility actions risk creating unnecessary attention or distraction?

Ignore any suggestions that introduce new goals or directions.

## Stopping point

You are done when:
- Your positioning fits on one line
- Your proof can be recalled without explanation
- Your visibility plan feels calm and sustainable

Perception compounds quietly.  
This module sets the direction.
